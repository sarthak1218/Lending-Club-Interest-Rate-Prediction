## Lending-Club-Interest-Rate-Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict interest rates for loans issued by Lending Club using machine learning models. By analyzing historical loan data and macroeconomic factors, the project seeks to build a model that can accurately estimate interest rates for new loan applications.

## Data Source

The project utilizes two main data sources:

1. **Lending Club Loan Data:** Historical data on loans issued by Lending Club, including loan details, borrower information, and loan performance. This data is obtained from Lending Club's website or publicly available datasets.

2. **Macroeconomic Data:** Data on macroeconomic indicators like interest rates, inflation rates, and CPI obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. This data provides context about the broader economic environment during the loan issuance period.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:** Raw loan data and macroeconomic data are cleaned and processed to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. New features are engineered to create more informative variables for the model.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Data visualization techniques are used to explore the relationships between variables, identify trends, and gain insights into factors that influence interest rates.

3. **Model Development:** Machine learning models, such as XGBoost and ARIMA, are employed to predict interest rates. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the models is assessed using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of predictions. 

5. **Inflation Adjustment:** The predicted interest rates are adjusted for inflation to provide a more realistic estimate of the cost of borrowing.

**Actual vs. Predicted Interest Rates** using an **XGBoost regression model**.
Each point represents a comparison between actual interest rates (x-axis) and the predicted interest rates (y-axis). The dashed diagonal line represents a perfect prediction line, where points lying on this line indicate accurate predictions. Points close to this line signify strong model performance, as the predicted values closely match the actual values. The tight clustering around the line suggests the XGBoost model has achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting interest rates within this dataset.

 **Interest Rate Forecast through 2017 using an ARIMA model**.
This graph represents the Interest Rate Forecast through 2017 using an ARIMA model, which was configured with parameters obtained from the auto_arima function. The blue line shows the actual historical interest rates from 2014 to mid-2016, while the red dashed line represents the forecasted interest rates for the year 2017.

The ARIMA model has extended the trend observed in the historical data, showing a predicted decrease in interest rates over the forecasted period. This visualization provides an overview of the model's ability to project future trends based on past data. It’s useful for understanding how well the ARIMA model anticipates changes in the interest rate and how closely it aligns with known economic patterns.

This graph illustrates the **Interest Rate Over Time for the observed data from 2014 to mid-2016**. The x-axis represents the time progression in monthly intervals, while the y-axis shows the interest rate values. The plot captures trends and fluctuations in the interest rate, allowing for an analysis of seasonality and long-term trends. A downward trend is visible initially, followed by more moderate fluctuations, providing insight into how interest rates evolved during this period. This visualization is useful for understanding the baseline data used in the model and observing any patterns that may impact forecasting.

**Interest Rate Forecast through 2019** generated by a **SARIMA model** with specified (p, d, q) and seasonal (P, D, Q, S) orders.

The blue line represents the actual historical interest rate data from 2014 to early 2017, while the red dashed line shows the SARIMA model's forecasted interest rates extending through 2019. This model captures both short-term and seasonal patterns observed in the historical data, projecting these into the future. The SARIMA model here is focused on seasonal trends and assumes a repeatable cyclical pattern, evident in the projected peaks and troughs.
This forecast provides insights based on past trends, making it useful for understanding potential interest rate fluctuations over the predicted period.


## Key Findings

- The project identifies key factors that significantly influence interest rates, including borrower creditworthiness, loan amount, loan term, and macroeconomic conditions.
- The developed models demonstrate reasonable accuracy in predicting interest rates, allowing for more informed loan pricing decisions.
- The inflation adjustment provides a valuable perspective for lenders and borrowers to understand the real cost of borrowing.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate more advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Experiment with different machine learning models and ensemble methods.
- Develop a web application to provide interactive predictions and insights.
